CAL FIRE\u2019s grant funds available to the public has grown from over $2 million in 2013/14 to over $150 million in 2019/2020, requiring a more robust system that can be used for managing a growing number of grants from the application process through final project reporting. CAL FIRE provides grants from a variety of funds, such as Federal, Greenhouse Gas (GHG), Bond funds, etc. The majority of funds are distributed between seven CAL FIRE programs: Fire Prevention, Forest Health, Forest Legacy, Forest Research, Urban and Community Forestry, California Forest Improvement Program, and Volunteer Fire Assistance. CAL FIRE receives over 600 applications and awards over 250 grants annually across all programs.\nCAL FIRE currently does not have an existing system of historical grant information. All grant information is being tracked manually across different program areas, from applications, financial information, scoring, reporting etc. utilizing a variety of formats (Excel spreadsheets, Word or PDF documents, Access database, etc.) The current process varies slightly for each of our different grant programs. Links to each of the funding opportunities and website https://www.fire.ca.gov/grants/california-forest-improvement-program/. Each program has a Procedural/User Guide that describes the process for each program.\neCivis Response: eCivis can meet or exceed CAL FIRE\u2019s requirements of 600 applicant and 250 grant requirements. eCivis Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) software platform is built using the most modern technology to support CAL FIRE programs: Fire Prevention, Forest Health, Forest Legacy, Forest Research, Urban and Community Forestry, California Forest Improvement Program, and Volunteer Fire Assistance.\nIn response to this RFQ, based on a review of CAL FIRE needs, requirements and timeframe, eCivis has recommended an implementation approach and project management plan that supports the rapid deployment needs and kickoff/go live goal of 6/30/2020. eCivis provides the latest technology, with ongoing investment to support the long-term needs of CAL FIRE.\n1. Perfect for today, ready for tomorrow. eCivis will absolutely meet the needs of the CAL FIRE today. But requirements and needs change. If needs and requirements change, eCivis will have the expertise, financial resources, and vision to support what is needed tomorrow.\n2. A proven methodology and results-focused approach. Our implementation strategy is collaborative, iterative and interactive; we will conduct workshops with a working grants management system throughout the design process to enable your project team members to see and understand the impacts\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.\nPage 4 of 57     \n\u00a9\nof any requested design decisions within the application. This benefits you by reducing rework and improving project team confidence that the desired benefits and results are achieved.\n3. Simple but sophisticated. eCivis is designed to be easy to use, easy to configure, easy to support, which makes delivery very flexible. The solution is functionally rich, and we have assembled a delivery team that has the experience to successfully deliver this solution\n", "Implementation Approach\nIn response to this RFQ, based on a review of CAL FIRE needs, requirements and timeframe, we are proposing the following implementation approach.\n(2 0% & P 44/ \u00b0 % {9 %7\u20189\"4\u20195 0 o\nDuring Discovery, eCivis will train the CAL FIRE project team and validate CAL FIRE\u2019s GMS requirements. System design takes a data-first approach, and focuses on the data that needs to be captured in the application.\neCivis will utilize a comprehensive implementation methodology and software development life cycle (SDLC) specifically for implementing our Grants Management Solution (GMS). We combine the best of Agile and Waterfall methodologies into one Iterative Development Approach to the SDLC. This means that documentation, sign-off processes, and thoroughness of Waterfall methodology is combined with the speed, flexibility, and results orientation of an agile methodology.\nLot n o]\nof Continuous Our SDLC also enforce Integration/Continuous Development configuration and quality standards to develop and release high-quality deliverables (including Product Configuration, Interfaces, Data Conversion and Reports) incremental manner. This in an implementation process is tailored to make sure client insight, input, requirements gathering, requirements documentation, and product delivery are clear and traceable to test-cases/scripts, your acceptance criteria, your intended benefits and the Requirements Traceability Matrix. The iterations provide CAL FIRE with practical insight into GMS functionality which in turns facilitates detail-level adjustments to configuration to meet your hard-to-define business process requirements.\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.\nPage 5 of 57     \n\u00a9\nThe GMS application is configured during test-driven iteration development cycles under which requirements and solutions evolve through a collaborative effort of the combined CAL FIRE/ eCivis team. Our Test-driven approach relies on the repetition of very short development iterations, based on system design and its acceptance criteria, where your requirements are turned into very specific test scripts and use cases. The configured software is then configured and improved to pass each test. This approach emphasizes adaptive planning, iterative configuration, incremental delivery of configured GMS modules, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to your changing requirements.\nThe GMS solution will be delivered using a phased approach which allows the GMS to run in parallel with CAL FIRE\u2019s legacy\u2019s systems to minimize impacts to business operations if needed. During the transition phase of the project, eCivis will work with CAL FIRE to determine the timing for cutover and which applications will be the system of record until all legacy applications are decommissioned. Our implementation approach entails the following phases:\n1. Plan Phase: The planning phase comprises the administrative and organizational steps necessary to initiate the project. It sets the foundation for the entire implementation by confirming the strategy, scope, executive alignment, timeline, and project members and their roles and responsibilities, as well as defining guidelines and standards for project documentation, communications, and issue/risk tracking. We will begin with an overall planning session that generates the Project Management Plan for the entire effort. We will then perform high-level discovery sessions, fit gap analysis and work interactively with CAL FIRE key functional staff to develop the detailed project schedule and align it with our development approach.\n2. Design Phase: One of the initial elements of the design phase is the orientation and training of CAL FIRE staff on the implementation approach, tools, and GMS application to enable them to understand its capabilities when asked to make design decisions. In the design phase, interactive workshops will be planned where project team members focus on communicating the project-related, to-be processes and associate them with leading practices available in the GMS solution. Various application design topics will be discussed with stakeholders as the organization adapts to the out of the box capabilities of the software. During the design sessions, we will use a structured governance and decision-making approach to make sure they run smoothly and efficiently. We will frequently ask the CAL FIRE team \u201care we meeting project goals and objectives\u201d as we move toward a consolidated system design. The following key activities will take place during the Design Phase.\n\u25cf Fit Gap Analysis/Future State Design. Traditionally, the Design Phase defines in detail the desired end-state for the applications and technologies that will be implemented. It accounts for all business procedures that will need to be performed in the application systems. It also defines how these systems will communicate with one another (for more information see Interface Workshops below). Likewise, the requirements around data that will need to be converted from legacy systems to the eCivis application modules are discussed, and key decisions (such as how far back, level of detail, etc.) are made.\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.\nPage 6 of 57     \n&\nInterface Workshops. Another key objective of the Design Phase is to define how the eCivis GMS interfaces with other systems. Similar to data conversions, the goal of Design is not to complete every interface, but rather, to simply make a prioritized list of all interfaces to and from eCivis for planning purposes. The eCivis interface resources will review previously completed interface documentation as part of the Business Process Review as well as discuss the requirements for the parallel interfaces.\nReporting Workshop. eCivis will review the reporting requirements with all team members. CAL FIRE will provide examples of current and desired future reports. These will be compared to standard system-generated GMS reports, and any gaps will be noted. 3. Build & Configure Phase: During the build and configure phase, the team configures the application. System Configuration will take a data-first approach, which focuses on the data to be captured, in conjunction with the accompanying eCivis screens/forms. Business logic and workflow that will be integrated with the screens/forms to support CAL FIRE\u2019s business rules and processes, and data conversion extract programs. GMS and interfaces are built. Data conversion import files are prepped by CAL FIRE for the execution of the first data conversion run. Test and training planning activities are initiated. The following are some of the key activities that will take place during the Build and Configure Phase.\n\u25cf System Configuration Review and Testing. Based on outcomes from Design, eCivis will make sure that GMS is configured with appropriate setup options. In addition, the team will perform limited data build conversions for a subset of data for testing purposes.\n\u25cf Test Plan. eCivis will work with CAL FIRE to build a consolidated testing plan. The goal of this plan is to provide a mature and reliable project standard with the intention of producing quality software. Timely stakeholder communication is an important part of the testing effort. During the testing phases, a weekly Test Review meeting between test resources summarizes and tracks activities on an ongoing basis. Test tools and any issues with training on test tools or issues with using them are also discussed in this weekly meeting.\n4. Validate Phase. The validate phase focuses on executing the steps described in the System Configuration and Development Approach section of this proposal. Key City stakeholders and users will create and execute validation scripts to ensure the application design is complete and accurate. The following key activities will take place during the Validation Phase.\n\u25cf User Acceptance Testing (UAT). User Acceptance Testing is the final round of hands on testing. As a SaaS provider, eCivis makes use of multiple deployment, staging, UAT, automated quality assurance testing, and production environments. Our engineering teams have documented and clear tight controls over access and processes for software and hardware that gets introduced at every stage of implementation.\n\u25cf Defect Resolution. Any issues identified during UAT will be logged and triaged by priority. The integration team will resolve the issues and they will be retested to verify resolution. In addition, the integration team will maintain a tracking log of testing schedules, cases, scripts,\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.\nPage 7 of 57     \n&\nand issues. Once user acceptance has been achieved, the data will be pushed into an eCivis production account and data integration will begin on a desired daily or weekly schedule.\n5. Transition Phase. The transition phase will start with conducting the necessary end-user training. It is also where key client project leaders evaluate the organization's readiness to \"go live\" and approve the strategy for a successful migration. Once the data has been migrated successfully to the production instance, operations are transitioned to the new system. The following key activities will take place during the Transition Phase.\n\u25cf Readiness Assessment. Based on all project activity to date, the project team will lead the process to assess any risks for going live on the desired date and make recommendations where appropriate. This allows the project team to focus on any outstanding issues that need to be addressed as well as gaining consensus on proceeding with the cutover process.\n\u25cf Contingency Planning. A contingency plan will also be developed for key activities so the appropriate actions for any issues that arise are well thought out in advance.\n\u25cf Post Live Support. The primary objective of the final phase is to support end users as they begin to use eCivis GMS and to transition responsibility for the maintenance of the GMS system from the project team. A block of hours has been set aside for post go-live conversion. During the project, a post go-live support plan will be developed based on the expected needs of the staff. This plan will specify the consulting staff who will be on site, and the timing for that support.\n", "Project Management Approach\nThe Project Management Plan (PMP) provides overall guidance and structure for this COTS Implementation. The PMP clarifies communication processes, describes governance processes and entities, clarifies roles and responsibilities, identifies feedback loops, defines iterative reviews and retrospectives, and illustrates planned analysis and project management processes.\neCivis has a mature, thorough project management and reporting approach and toolset that we will use to guide the successful completion of the business transformation and GMS implementation. We utilize a project management methodology that complies with PMI\u2019s Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) and, as such, organizes projects around five commonly-utilized process groups: Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and Closing. All tasks and activities are slotted into one of these five process groups. Our overall approach comprises practices from the PMBOK, Six Sigma, leading industry practices such as Agile and Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe).\nOur eCivis Project Manager will work with CAL FIRE\u2019s Project Manager to review the Project Management Plan to illustrate where it aligns with our iterative implementation methodology. The goals of this alignment is to clarify communication processes, describe governance processes and entities, describe roles and\n", "Activity Coordination, Reporting, and Monitoring\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.\nPage 8 of 57     \n&\nresponsibilities, identify feedback loops, and define iterative reviews and retrospectives. The benefit of this approach is that it reduces Project complexity by reducing the time required to confirm requirements, configure the GMS product, and test and remediate defects.\neCivis will use a hybrid approach that combines the best of Agile and Waterfall methodologies into one iterative development approach. This means that documentation, sign-off processes and thoroughness of Waterfall methodology would be combined with the speed, flexibility, and results orientation of an Agile methodology to help ensure that engagement involves small teams, adapts to the possibility of changing requirements, and focuses on quality assurance. This project management framework has the following supportive characteristics:\n1. Rigor \u2013 Spans across all phases of the project lifecycle and provides specific guidelines to project managers based on best practices and the collective institutionalized knowledge that eCivis project managers have earned during years of project experience.\n2. Discipline \u2013 Provides project managers with specific measures to gauge the status of projects and the iterative development of key project deliverables and to identify deficiencies as early as possible in the project.\n3. Optimal \u2013 Provides the framework for project managers to get the entire project team involved at the appropriate level and deliver maximum value while being flexible and adaptable.\n4. Repeatability \u2013 Provides a standardized methodology that incorporates real-life lessons learned on similar projects. The eCivis Project Management Methodology is continually updated to incorporate the successful approaches utilized successfully with other clients.\n5. Trigger Mechanisms \u2013 Incorporates built-in mechanisms (i.e., sprint entrance and exit criteria) that indicate the appropriate time to elevate issues and risks to the Project Director.\n", "Communication and Interaction\neCivis places emphasis on communication. Interaction consists of not only identifying and communicating to stakeholders, but also understanding their perceptions of, and readiness for, change.\n", "Stakeholder Identification and Analysis\nOne of our first activities will be to facilitate a session with project sponsors and leadership to identify and analyze stakeholders impacted by the change. Our process focuses on understanding the unique expectations, needs, and level of influence of each stakeholder. The process provides necessary information to anticipate areas of potential resistance and identify meaningful, targeted strategies to mitigate those areas accordingly.\n", "Our Work Plan\nTo deliver the entire scope specified in the RFP, our approach is to run three focused, dedicated yet interrelated work streams. Each stream will have its own team that will simultaneously configure the grants management\nUse or disclosure of data contained on this sheet is subject to the restriction on the title page of this proposal or quotation.\nPage 9 of 57     \n\u00a9\nsystem while creating project deliverables aligned to our SDLC phases. The key elements of how our work will be done are listed and described below:\n1. COTS Implementation \u2013 The eCivis proprietary implementation methodology for a cloud-based, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) COTS product. This will help us install, configure, integrate, test, implement, and train internal and external users on the eCivis system utilizing the phases in our implementation approach.\n2. Agile-Implementation \u2013 Our Agile-based deployment is designed to achieve the maximum benefit in the shortest time possible and is intended to achieve early successes using the system as early as the first 30 days. This method ensures that the impact of the product is realized quickly, while also allowing for adjusting dynamically.\n3. Project Management (PM) and Organizational Change Management (OCM) Methodologies \u2013 We will be using a combination of project management methodologies, such as PMBOK and ADKAR to meet the contractually obligated deliverables and prepare the business for the anticipated change.\n", "4.0 OBJECTIVE\nCAL FIRE is seeking a cloud-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solution that will manage existing grants as well as the Pre-Award (i.e. post a funding announcement, receive, review, and score submitted applications), Sub-Award, and Post-Award processes for future grant funding.\nThe system should comply with the cloud-based SaaS requirements in the California State Administrative Manual (SAM) \u2013 INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY) Rev. 439, POLICY 4983.1\nThe system should allow applicants to register for an account and apply online from the CAL FIRE Grants website, attach supporting documentation as well as allow them to revisit their application to edit.
